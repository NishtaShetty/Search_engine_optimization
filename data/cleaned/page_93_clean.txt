previous findings suggest adults get older less likely participate ae adult education international adult literacy survey ials nationally representative samples adults aged oecd countries found older age groups lower participation rates younger age groups particularly adults aged average three times likely participate older adults aged eurobarometer survey national representative samples adult aged european union countries also revealed adults three youngest age groups examined ages ages ages likely participate ae age group moreover eurobarometer survey shows participation rate declined younger older adults participation rate european countries adults aged rate began decline adults aged also fell adults aged participation rate adults reason older adults participation declined relates mainly lack promotion support people get old chances take promotion ae programs reduced many oecd european countries employers often support workers attend ae programs since consider workers highereducated skilled crucial indicators development companies therefore older adults get promotions employers gradual loss seniority learning ability performance since older adults rarely offered promotion employers cost would obstacle participation unable take courses even wanted take part programmes moreover lack motivation unavailability learning opportunities could additional reasons older
