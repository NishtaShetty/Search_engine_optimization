individuals rather broad net cast phishing attempts privilege escalation privilege escalation describes situation attacker level restricted access able without authorization elevate privileges access level example standard computer user may able exploit vulnerability system gain access restricted data even become root full unrestricted access system severity attacks range attacks simply sending unsolicited email ransomware attack large amounts data privilege escalation usually starts social engineering techniques often phishing privilege escalation separated two strategies horizontal
