released timothy fitz published article detailing imvus engineering team built using first practical cd system post originally met skepticism quickly caught found widespread adoption part lean software development methodology also based imvu practices core activities ci developers colocate code changes shared integration area frequently resulting integrated codebase verified correctness first part generally involves merging changes common version control branch second part generally involves automated processes including building testing many processes typically server builds integration area frequently ie commit periodically like day server may perform quality control checks running unit tests collect software quality metrics via processes static analysis performance testing related practices section contains instructions advice howto content please help rewrite content encyclopedic move wikiversity wikibooks wikivoyage may section lists best practices practitioners practices enhance ci build automation main article build automation build automation best practice build automation automate building proponents ci recommend single command capability building system automation often includes automating integration often includes deployment productionlike environment many cases build script compiles binaries also generates documentation website pages statistics distribution media debian deb red hat rpm windows msi files atomic commits ci requires version control system support atomic commits ie developers changes handled single commit committing changes making code change developer creates branch copy current codebase changes committed repository copy diverges latest version longer development continues branch without merging integration branch greater risk multiple integration conflicts failures developer branch eventually merged back developers submit code repository must first update code reflect changes repository since took copy changes repository contains work developers must submitting changes eventually repository may become different developers baselines enter sometimes referred merge hell integration hell time takes integrate exceeds time took make original changes testing locally proponents ci suggest developers use testdriven development ensure unit tests pass locally committing integration branch one developers work break another developers copy incomplete features disabled committing using feature toggles continuous delivery continuous deployment continuous delivery ensures software checked integration branch always state deployed users continuous deployment automates deployment process continuous delivery continuous deployment often performed conjunction ci together form cicd pipeline version control main article version control proponents ci recommend storing files information needed building version control git repository system buildable fresh checkout require additional dependencies martin fowler recommends developers commit integration branch commit frequently developers reduce effort resolving conflicting changes synchronizing changes frequently least daily checking weeks worth work risks conflict likelihood occurrence complexity resolve relatively small conflicts significantly easier resolve larger ones integrating committing changes least day considered good practice often better daily build building daily often generally recommended every commit built system build commits current working version verify integrate correctly common practice use automated continuous integration although may done manually automated continuous integration employs continuous integration server daemon monitor revision control system changes automatically run build process every bugfix commit come test case fixing bug good practice push test case reproduces bug avoids fix reverted bug reappear known regression keep build fast build needs complete rapidly problem integration quickly identified test clone production environment main article test environment test environment lead failures tested systems deploy production environment production environment may differ test environment significant way however building replica production environment costprohibitive instead test environment separate preproduction environment staging built scalable version production environment alleviate costs maintaining technology stack composition nuances within test environments service virtualisation commonly used obtain ondemand access dependencies eg apis thirdparty applications services mainframes etc beyond teams control still evolving complex configure virtual test lab make easy get latest deliverables making builds readily available stakeholders testers reduce amount rework necessary rebuilding feature doesnt meet requirements additionally early testing reduces chances defects survive deployment finding errors earlier reduce amount work necessary resolve programmers start day updating project repository way stay date everyone see results latest build easy find whether build breaks made relevant change change automate deployment ci systems allow running scripts build finishes situations possible write script deploy application live test server everyone look advance way thinking continuous deployment calls software deployed directly production often additional automation prevent defects regressions benefits section needs additional citations verification please help improve article adding citations reliable sources section unsourced material may challenged removed may learn remove message ci benefits include facilitates detecting bugs earlier reduces effort find cause bugs ci test fails changes since last good build contain causing change build change exactly one change cause avoids chaos integrating many changes test fails bug found reverting codebase good state results fewer lost changes frequent availability knowngood build testing demo release frequent code commit encourages modular less complex code quick feedback systemwide impact code changes supports collection software metrics code coverage code complexity risks risks ci include build system setup requires effort writing maintaining automated test suite requires effort value added depends quality tests high build latency sitting queue limits value implies incomplete code integrated counter developers preferred practice safety missioncritical development assurance eg doc iso require documentation review may difficult achieve best practices cloud systems following practices enhance productivity pipelines especially systems hosted cloud number pipelines small teams productive one repository one pipeline contrast
