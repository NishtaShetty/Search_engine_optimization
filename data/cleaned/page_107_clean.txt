requirement problem typically combines mental setclinging previously successful methodpage needed visual problems also produce mentally invented constraintspage needed famous example dot problem nine dots arranged threebythree grid pattern must connected drawing four straight line segments without lifting pen paper backtracking along line subject typically assumes pen must stay within outer square dots solution requires lines continuing beyond frame reers found solution rate within brief allotted time problem produced expression think outside boxpage needed problems typically solved via sudden insight leaps mental barriers often long toil difficult depending subject structured problem mind draw past experiences well juggle information working memory example envisioning dots connected outside framing square requires visualizing unconventional arrangement strain working memory irrelevant information see also information overload mass media irrelevant information specification data presented problem unrelated solution solver assumes information presented needs used often derails problem solving process making relatively simple problems much harder example fifteen percent people topeka unlisted telephone numbers select names random topeka phone book many people unlisted phone numberspage needed obvious answer fact none unlisted people would listed among kind trick question often used aptitude tests cognitive evaluations though inherently difficult require independent thinking necessarily common mathematical word problems often include irrelevant qualitative numerical information extra challenge avoiding barriers changing problem representation disruption caused cognitive biases depend information represented visually verbally mathematically classic example buddhist monk problem buddhist monk begins dawn one day walking mountain reaches top sunset meditates top several days one dawn begins walk back foot mountain reaches sunset making assumptions starting stopping pace trips prove place path occupies hour day two separate journeys problem addressed verbal context trying describe monks progress day becomes much easier paragraph represented mathematically function one visualizes graph whose horizontal axis time day whose vertical axis shows monks position altitude path time superimposing two journey curves traverse opposite diagonals rectangle one sees must cross somewhere visual representation graphing resolved difficulty similar strategies often improve problem solving tests barriers individuals people engaged problem solving tend overlook subtractive changes even critical elements efficient solutions example city planner may decide solution decrease traffic congestion would add another lane highway rather finding ways
