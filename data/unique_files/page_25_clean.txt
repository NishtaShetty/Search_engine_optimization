organisms occurs passing discrete heritable units called genes parents offspring property first observed gregor mendel studied segregation heritable traits pea plants showing example flowers single plant either purple whitebut never intermediate two colors discrete versions gene controlling inherited phenotypes called alleles case pea diploid species individual plant two copies gene one copy inherited parent many species including humans pattern inheritance diploid organisms two copies allele given gene called homozygous gene locus organisms two different alleles given gene called heterozygous set alleles given organism called genotype observable traits organism called phenotype organisms heterozygous gene often one allele called dominant qualities dominate phenotype organism allele called recessive qualities recede observed alleles complete dominance instead incomplete dominance expressing intermediate phenotype codominance expressing alleles pair organisms reproduce sexually offspring randomly inherit one two alleles parent observations discrete inheritance segregation alleles collectively known mendels first law law segregation however probability getting one
