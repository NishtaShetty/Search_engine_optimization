focus one specific task rather overwhelmed multiple features tasks design experts strongly advocate one task per screen recommend breaking long forms pages progressively revealing new tasks fields minimize clutter reduce cognitive load makes use app seamless possible preserves natural flow app design experts suggest incorporating autocomplete spellcheck predictive text assistance dropdown menus reduce cognitive load design experts also recommend state app preserved users temporarily leave app reenter users continue use left simple around people uninstalled apps due complicated interface design experts state paramount present bar visibly app help users navigate frequently used highpriority screens instantly suggest use recognizable icons specific device operating system help users easily take actions opening menu changing settings going back screen ing within page according user confused navigating app orderly clear logical flow drives engagement discovery app notifications reported around users uninstall app due frequent push notifications notifications sent careful planning according design experts experts state notifications sent time convenient users time zone
