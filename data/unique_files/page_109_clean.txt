historians tried explain process innovation rather assuming technological inventions technological progress result productivity growth concept innovation emerged second world war mostly thanks works joseph schumpeter described economic effects innovation processes constructive destruction today consistent neoschumpeterian scholars see innovation neutral apolitical processes rather innovation seen
