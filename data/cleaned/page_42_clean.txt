statistical turn rising importance quantitative evaluation period statistical nlp spresent natural language processing systems based complex sets handwritten rules starting late however revolution natural language processing introduction machine learning algorithms language processing due steady increase computational power see moores law gradual lessening dominance chomskyan theories linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged sort corpus linguistics underlies machinelearning approach language processing many notable early successes statistical methods nlp occurred field machine translation due especially work ibm ibm alignment models systems able take advantage existing multilingual textual corpora produced parliament canada european union result laws calling translation governmental proceedings official languages corresponding systems government however systems depended corpora specifically developed tasks implemented systems often continues major limitation success systems result great deal gone methods effectively learning limited amounts data growth web increasing amounts raw unannotated language data become available since mids thus increasingly focused unsupervised semisupervised learning algorithms algorithms learn data handannotated desired answers using combination annotated nonannotated data generally task much difficult supervised learning typically produces less accurate results given amount input data however enormous amount nonannotated data available including among things entire content world wide web often make worse efficiency algorithm used low enough time complexity practical word ngram model time best statistical algorithm outperformed multilayer perceptron single hidden layer context length several words trained million words bengio et al tom mikolov phd student brno university technology coauthors applied simple recurrent neural network single hidden layer language modelling following years went develop wordvec representation learning deep neural networkstyle featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread natural language processing popularity due partly flurry results showing techniques achieve stateoftheart results many natural language tasks eg language modeling parsing increasingly important medicine healthcare nlp helps analyze notes text electronic health records would otherwise inaccessible study seeking improve care protect patient privacy approaches symbolic statistical neural networks symbolic approach ie handcoding set rules manipulating symbols coupled dictionary lookup historically first approach used ai general nlp particular writing grammars devising heuristic rules stemming machine learning approaches include statistical neural networks hand many advantages symbolic approach statistical neural networks methods focus common cases extracted corpus texts whereas rulebased approach needs provide rules rare cases common ones equally language models produced either statistical neural networks methods robust unfamiliar eg containing words structures seen erroneous input eg misspelled words words accidentally omitted comparison rulebased systems also costly produce larger probabilistic language model accurate becomes contrast rulebased systems gain accuracy increasing amount complexity rules leading intractability problems rulebased systems commonly used amount training data insufficient successfully apply machine learning methods eg machine translation lowresource languages provided apertium system preprocessing nlp pipelines eg tokenization postprocessing transforming output nlp pipelines eg knowledge extraction syntactic parses statistical approach late mids statistical approach ended period ai winter caused inefficiencies rulebased approaches earliest decision trees producing systems hard ifthen rules still similar old rulebased approaches introduction hidden markov models applied partofspeech tagging announced end old rulebased approach neural networks information artificial neural network major drawback statistical methods require elaborate feature engineering since statistical approach replaced neural networks approach using semantic networks word embeddings capture semantic properties words intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging dependency parsing needed anymore neural machine translation based thennewly invented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete intermediate steps word alignment previously necessary statistical machine translation common nlp tasks following list commonly reed tasks natural language processing tasks direct realworld applications others commonly serve subtasks used aid solving larger tasks though natural language processing tasks closely intertwined subdivided categories convenience coarse division given text speech processing optical character recognition ocr given image representing printed text determine corresponding text speech recognition given sound clip person people speaking determine textual representation speech opposite text speech one extremely difficult problems colloquially termed aicomplete see natural speech hardly pauses successive words thus speech segmentation necessary subtask speech recognition see spoken languages sounds representing successive letters blend process termed coarticulation conversion analog signal discrete characters difficult process also given words language spoken people different accents speech recognition software must able recognize wide variety input identical terms textual equivalent speech segmentation given sound clip person people speaking separate words subtask speech recognition typically grouped texttospeech given text transform units produce spoken representation texttospeech used aid visually impaired word segmentation tokenization tokenization process used text analysis divides text individual words word fragments technique results two key components word index tokenized text word index list maps unique words specific numerical identifiers tokenized text replaces word corresponding numerical token numerical tokens used various deep learning methods language like english fairly trivial since words usually separated spaces however written languages like chinese japanese thai mark word boundaries fashion languages text segmentation significant task requiring knowledge vocabulary morphology words language sometimes process also used cases like bag words bow creation data mining morphological analysis lemmatization task removing inflectional endings return base dictionary form word also known lemma lemmatization another technique reducing words normalized form case transformation actually uses dictionary map words actual form morphological segmentation separate words individual morphemes identify class morphemes difficulty task depends greatly complexity morphology ie structure words language considered english fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology thus often possible ignore task entirely simply model possible forms word eg open opens opened opening separate words languages turkish meitei highly agglutinated indian language however approach possible dictionary entry thousands possible word forms partofspeech tagging given sentence determine part speech pos word many words especially common ones serve multiple parts speech example book noun book table verb book flight set noun verb adjective least five different parts speech stemming process reducing inflected sometimes derived words base form eg close root closed closing close closer etc stemming yields similar results lemmatization grounds rules
