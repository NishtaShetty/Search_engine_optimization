performance behavior something done employee concept differentiates performance outcomes outcomes result partially individuals performance also result influences words factors determine outcomes employees behaviors actions campbell allows exceptions defining performance behavior instance clarifies performance directly observable actions individual consist mental productions answers decisions however performance needs individuals control regardless whether performance interest mental behavioral difference individual controlled action outcomes best conveyed example sales job favorable outcome certain level revenue generated sale something merchandise service insurance revenue generated depending behavior employees employee performs sales job well able move merchandise however certain factors employees behavior influence revenue generated example sales might slump due economic conditions changes customer preferences production bottlenecks etc conditions employee performance adequate yet sales remain low first performance second effectiveness performance one decouple two performance effectiveness another closely related construct productivity one think productivity comparison amount effectiveness results certain level cost associated effectiveness words productivity ratio outputs inputsthose inputs effort monetary costs resources etc utility another related construct defined value particular level performance effectiveness productivity utilities performance effectiveness productivity value judgments organizational goal relevance another key feature job performance goal relevant performance must directed toward organizational goals relevant job role therefore performance include activities effort expended toward achieving peripheral goals example effort put toward goal getting work shortest amount time performance except concerned avoiding lateness factors despite emphasis defining predicting job performance single unified construct vastly many jobs different performance standards job performance consists one kind behavior campbell proposed eight factor model performance based factor analytic attempts capture factors job performance

organizations goal downtime behaviors behaviors employees engage free time either work offsite downtime behaviors occur offsite considered job performance subsequently affect job performance example outside behaviors cause absenteeism destructivehazardous behaviors addition models dividing performance dimensions others identified different types behaviors making performance types another way classify job performance terms task contextual citizenship counterproductive behaviors whereas task performance describes obligatory behaviors contextual behaviors behaviors fulfill specific aspects jobs required role citizenship behaviors defined behaviors contribute goals organization effect social psychological conditions counterproductive behaviors hand intentional actions employees
