aerobic exercise physical activity uses large muscle groups causes body use oxygen would resting goal aerobic exercise increase cardiovascular endurance examples aerobic exercise include running cycling swimming brisk walking skipping rope rowing hiking dancing playing tennis continuous training long distance running anaerobic exercise includes strength resistance training firm strengthen increase muscle mass well improve bone density balance coordination examples strength exercises pushups pullups lunges squats bench press anaerobic exercise also includes weight training functional training eccentric training interval training sprinting highintensity interval training increase shortterm muscle strength flexibility exercises stretch lengthen muscles activities stretching help
