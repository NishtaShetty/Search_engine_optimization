accumulation machinery capital better education human capital factors lead increased economic output time however output always increase consistently time business cycles cause shortterm drops output called recessions economists look macroeconomic policies prevent economies slipping either recessions overheating lead higher productivity levels standards living unemployment main article unemployment chart using us data showing relationship economic growth unemployment expressed okuns law relationship demonstrates cyclical unemployment high shortrun gdp growth leads lower unemployment rate amount unemployment economy measured unemployment rate ie percentage persons labor force job actively looking one people retired pursuing education discouraged seeking work lack job prospects part labor force consequently counted unemployed either unemployment shortrun cyclical component depends business cycle permanent structural component loosely thought average unemployment rate economy extended periods often termed natural structural rate unemployment cyclical unemployment occurs growth stagnates okuns law represents empirical relationship unemployment shortrun gdp growth original version okuns law states increase output would lead decrease unemployment structural natural rate unemployment level unemployment occur mediumrun equilibrium ie situation cyclical unemployment rate zero may several reasons positive unemployment level even cyclically neutral situation foundation kind market failure unemployment also called frictional unemployment occurs workers firms heterogeneous imperfect information generally causing timeconsuming matching process filling job vacancy firm prospective worker often unemployed sectoral shifts reasons changed demand firms workers particular skills characteristics occur continually changing economy may also cause unemployment increased mismatch efficiency wage models labor market models firms choose lower wages level supply equals demand lower wages would lower employees efficiency levels trade unions important actors labor market countries may exercise market power order keep wages marketclearing level benefice members even cost unemployment legal minimum wages may prevent wage falling marketclearing level causing unemployment among lowskilled lowpaid workers case employers monopsony power however employment effects may opposite sign inflation deflation changes tenyear moving averages price level growth money supply using measure supply hard currency money held types bank accounts us long run two series show clear positive correlation general price increase across entire economy called inflation prices decrease deflation economists measure changes prices price indexes inflation increase economy becomes overheated grows quickly similarly declining economy lead decreasing inflation even cases deflation central bankers conducting monetary policy usually main priority avoid high inflation typically adjusting interest rates high inflation well deflation lead increased uncertainty negative consequences particular inflation deflation unexpected consequently central banks aim positive stable high inflation level changes inflation level may result several factors much aggregate demand economy cause overheating raising inflation rates via phillips curve tight labor market leading large wage increases transmitted increases price products employers little aggregate demand opposite effect creating unemployment lower wages thereby decreasing inflation aggregate supply shocks also affect

areas gdp equation using expenditure approach one way calculate gross domestic product total net output expenditure method gdp essentially tells big economy larger gdp value bigger economy expenditure approach involves looking four main components consumer spending government spending investment spending net exports consumer spending made ordinary consumers spending money different kinds products also investing money residential markets government spending involves government spending money goods services may assist consumers businesses spending well instance purchasing physical capital businesses transfer payments includes things like welfare social security payments things government pays included final calculation expenditure approach paying final goods services investment spending involves businesses spending money physical capitalequipment help producing goods services lastly net exports exports minus imports exports goods services country selling people abroad

employment interest money terms macrodynamics macroanalysis introduced ragnar frisch lawrence klein used word macroeconomics journal title naturally several themes central macroeconomic discussed thoughtful economists writers long keynes particular macroeconomic questions keynes topic two longstanding traditions business cycle theory monetary theory william stanley jevons one pioneers first tradition whereas quantity theory money labelled oldest surviving theory economics example second described already th century martn de azpilcueta later discussed personalities like john locke david hume first decades th century monetary theory dominated eminent economists alfred marshall knut wicksell irving fisher keynes keynesian economics great depression struck reigning economists difficulty explaining goods could go unsold workers could left unemployed prevailing neoclassical economics paradigm prices wages would drop market cleared goods labor sold keynes main work general theory initiated known keynesian revolution offered new interpretation events whole intellectural framework novel theory economics explained markets might clear would evolve school thought known keynesian economics also called keynesianism keynesian theory keynes theory aggregate demand keynes called effective demand key determining output even keynes conceded output might eventually return mediumrun equilibrium potential level process would slow best keynes coined term liquidity preference preferred name also known money demand explained monetary policy might affect aggregate demand time offering clear policy recommendations active role fiscal policy stabilizing aggregate demand hence output employment addition explained multiplier effect would magnify small decrease consumption investment cause declines throughout economy noted role uncertainty animal spirits play economy generation following keynes combined macroeconomics general theory neoclassical microeconomics create neoclassical synthesis economists accepted synthesis view macroeconomy economists like paul samuelson franco modigliani james tobin robert solow developed formal keynesian models contributed formal theories consumption investment money demand fleshed keynesian framework monetarism milton friedman updated quantity theory money include role money demand argued role money economy sufficient explain great depression aggregate demand oriented explanations necessary friedman also argued monetary policy effective fiscal policy however friedman doubted governments ability finetune economy monetary policy generally favored policy steady growth money supply instead frequent intervention friedman also challenged original simple phillips curve relationship inflation unemployment friedman edmund phelps monetarist proposed augmented version phillips curve excluded possibility stable longrun tradeoff inflation unemployment oil shocks created high unemployment high inflation friedman phelps vindicated monetarism particularly influential early fell favor central banks found results disappointing trying target money supply instead interest rates monetarists recommended concluding relationships money growth inflation real gdp growth unstable useful practical monetary policy making new classical economics new classical macroeconomics challenged keynesian school central development new classical thought came robert lucas introduced rational expectations macroeconomics prior lucas economists generally used adaptive expectations agents assumed look recent past make expectations future rational expectations agents assumed sophisticated consumers simply assume inflation rate average past years look current monetary policy economic conditions make informed forecast new classical models rational expectations monetary policy limited impact lucas also made influential critique keynesian empirical models argued forecasting models based empirical relationships would keep producing

keynesian demanddriven considerations solowswan model worked robert solow independently trevor swan achieved longlasting success however still today common textbook model explaining economic growth longrun model operates production function national output product two inputs capital labor solow model assumes labor capital used constant rates without fluctuations unemployment capital utilization commonly seen business cycles model increases output ie economic growth occur increase capital stock larger population technological advancements lead higher productivity total factor productivity increase savings rate leads temporary increase economy creates capital adds output however eventually depreciation rate limit expansion capital savings used replacing depreciated capital savings remain pay additional expansion capital solows model suggests economic growth terms output per capita depends solely technological advances enhance productivity solow model interpreted special case general ramsey growth model households savings rates constant solow model derived explicit intertemporal utility function endogenous growth theory arose challenge neoclassical growth theory ramsey

shortrun policies aimed mitigating harmful consequences business cycles known stabilization policy medium longrun policies targeted improving structural levels macroeconomic variables stabilization policy usually implemented two sets fiscal monetary policy forms policy used stabilize economy ie limiting effects business cycle conducting expansive policy economy recession contractive policy case overheating structural policies may labor market policies aim change structural unemployment rate policies affect longrun propensities save invest engage education development monetary policy information monetary policy central banks conduct monetary policy mainly adjusting shortterm interest rates actual method interest rate changed differs central bank central bank typically implementation happens either directly via administratively changing central banks offered interest rates indirectly via open market operations via monetary transmission mechanism interest rate changes affect investment consumption asset prices like listed companies shares prices house prices exchange rate reactions export import way aggregate demand employment ultimately inflation affected expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates increasing economic activity whereas contractionary monetary policy raises interest rates case fixed exchange rate system interest rate decisions together direct intervention central banks exchange rate dynamics major control exchange rate developed countries central banks follow inflation targeting focusing keeping mediumterm inflation close explicit target say within explicit range includes federal reserve european central bank generally considered follow strategy close inflation targeting even though officially label inflation targeters practice official inflation targeting often leaves room central bank also help stabilize output employment strategy known flexible inflation targeting emerging economies focus monetary policy maintaining fixed exchange rate regime aligning currency one foreign currencies typically us dollar euro conventional monetary policy ineffective situations liquidity trap nominal interest rates near zero central banks loosen monetary policy conventional means situation may use unconventional monetary policy quantitative easing help stabilize output quantity easing implemented buying government bonds also assets corporate bonds stocks securities allows lower interest rates broader class assets beyond government bonds similar strategy lower longterm interest rates buying longterm bonds selling shortterm bonds create flat yield curve known us operation twist fiscal policy information fiscal policy fiscal policy use governments revenue taxes expenditure instruments influence economy example economy producing less potential output government spending used employ idle resources boost output taxes could lowered boost private consumption similar effect government spending tax cuts make entire output gap multiplier effect affects impact government spending instance government pays bridge project adds value bridge output also allows bridge workers increase consumption investment helps close output gap effects fiscal policy limited partial full crowding government takes spending projects limits amount resources available private sector use full crowding occurs extreme case government spending simply replaces private sector output instead adding additional output economy crowding effect may also occur government spending lead higher interest rates would limit investment fiscal policy implemented automatic stabilizers without active decisions politicians automatic stabilizers suffer policy lags discretionary fiscal policy automatic stabilizers use conventional fiscal mechanisms take effect soon economy takes downturn spending unemployment benefits automatically increases unemployment rises tax revenues decrease shelters private income consumption part fall market income comparison fiscal monetary policy general consensus monetary fiscal instruments may affect demand activity short run ie business cycle economists usually favor monetary fiscal policy mitigate moderate fluctuations however two major advantages first monetary policy generally implemented independent central banks instead political institutions control fiscal policy independent central banks less likely subject political pressures overly expansionary policies second monetary policy may suffer shorter inside lags outside lags fiscal policy exceptions however firstly case major shock monetary stabilization policy may sufficient supplemented active fiscal stabilization secondly case low interest level economy may liquidity trap monetary policy becomes ineffective makes fiscal policy potent tool stabilize economy thirdly regimes monetary policy tied fulfilling targets particular fixed exchange rate regimes central bank simultaneously adjust interest rates mitigate domestic business cycle fluctuations making fiscal policy usable tool countries macroeconomic models information macroeconomic model macroeconomic teaching informed debates normally evolve around formal diagrammatic equational macroeconomic models clarify assumptions show consequences precise way models include simple theoretical models often containing equations used teaching highlight key basic
