linguistic communication using sounds sign language writing well animals exchanging information attempts communicate intelligent extraterrestrial life communication commonly defined transmission information precise definition disputed disagreements whether unintentional failed transmissions included whether communication transmits meaning also creates models communication simplified overviews main components interactions many models include idea source uses coding system express information form message message sent channel receiver decode understand main field inquiry investigating communication called communication studies common way classify communication whether information exchanged humans members species nonliving entities computers human communication central contrast verbal nonverbal communication verbal communication involves exchange messages linguistic form including spoken written messages well sign language nonverbal communication happens without use linguistic system example using body language touch facial expressions another distinction interpersonal communication happens distinct persons intrapersonal communication communication oneself communicative competence ability communicate well applies skills formulating messages understanding nonhuman forms communication include animal plant communication reers field often refine definition communicative behavior including criteria observable responses present participants benefit exchange animal communication used areas like courtship mating parentoffspring relations selfdefense communication chemicals particularly important relatively immobile plants example maple trees release socalled volatile organic compounds air warn plants herbivore attack communication takes place members species reason purpose usually form cooperation common different species interspecies communication happens mainly cases symbiotic relationships instance many flowers use symmetrical shapes distinctive colors signal insects nectar located humans engage interspecies communication interacting pets working animals human communication long history people exchange information changed time changes usually triggered development new communication technologies examples invention writing systems development mass printing use radio television invention internet technological advances also led new forms communication exchange data computers definitions word communication root latin verb communicare means share make common communication usually understood transmission information message conveyed sender receiver using medium sound written signs bodily movements electricity sender receiver often distinct individuals also possible individual communicate cases sender receiver individuals groups like organizations social classes nations different sense term communication refers message communicated field inquiry studying communicational phenomena precise characterization communication disputed many scholars raised doubts single definition capture term accurately difficulties come fact term applied diverse phenomena different contexts often slightly different meanings issue right definition affects process many levels includes issues like empirical phenomena observed categorized hypotheses laws formulated well systematic theories based steps articulated definitions broad encompass unconscious nonhuman behavior broad definition many animals communicate within species flowers communicate signaling location nectar bees colors shapes definitions restrict communication conscious interactions among human beings approaches focus use symbols signs others stress role understanding interaction power transmission ideas various characterizations see communicators intent send message central component view transmission information sufficient communication happens unintentionally version view given philosopher paul grice identifies communication actions aim make recipient aware communicators intention one question regard whether successful transmissions information regarded communication example distortion may interfere change actual message originally intended closely related problem whether acts deliberate deception constitute communication according broad definition literary critic richards communication happens one mind acts upon environment transmit experience another mind another interpretation given communication theorists claude shannon warren weaver characterize communication transmission information brought interaction several components source message encoder channel decoder receiver transmission view rejected transactional constitutive views hold communication transmission information also creation meaning transactional constitutive perspectives hold communication shapes participants experience conceptualizing world making sense environment reers studying animal plant communication focus less meaningmaking instead often define communicative behavior features playing beneficial role survival reproduction observable response models communication main article models communication models communication conceptual representations process communication goal provide simplified overview main components makes easier reers formulate hypotheses apply communicationrelated concepts realworld cases test predictions due simplified presentation may lack conceptual complexity needed comprehensive understanding essential aspects communication usually presented visually form diagrams showing basic components interaction models communication often categorized based intended applications conceptualize communication models general sense intended forms communication specialized models aim describe specific forms models mass communication one influential way classify communication distinguish linear transmission interaction transaction models linear transmission models focus sender transmits information receiver linear flow information goes single direction view rejected interaction models include feedback loop feedback needed describe many forms communication conversation listener may respond speaker expressing opinion asking clarification interaction models represent process form twoway communication communicators take turns sending receiving messages transaction models refine picture allowing representations sending responding time modification needed describe listener give feedback facetoface conversation person talking examples nonverbal feedback body posture facial expression transaction models also hold meaning produced communication exist independently lasswells model communication based five questions corresponding five basic components early models developed middle th century linear transmission models lasswells model example based five fundamental questions says channel effect goal questions identify basic components involved communicative process sender message channel receiver effect lasswells model initially conceived model mass communication applied fields well communication theorists like richard braddock expanded including additional questions like circumstances purpose shannonweaver model communication focuses message first translated signal back message shannonweaver model another influential linear transmission model based idea source creates message translated signal transmitter noise may interfere distort signal signal reaches receiver translated back message made available destination landline telephone call person calling source telephone transmitter transmitter translates message electrical signal travels wire acts channel person taking call destination telephone receiver shannonweaver model includes indepth discussion noise distort signal successful communication achieved despite noise happen making message partially redundant decoding possible nonetheless influential linear transmission models include gerbners model berlos model schramms model communication focuses processes encoding decoding well feedback earliest interaction model developed communication theorist wilbur schramm states communication starts source idea expresses form message process called encoding happens using code ie sign system able express idea instance visual auditory signs message sent destination decode interpret understand response formulate idea encode message send back form feedback another innovation schramms model previous experience necessary able encode decode messages communication successful fields experience source destination overlap first transactional model proposed communication theorist dean barnlund understands communication production meaning rather production messages goal decrease uncertainty arrive shared understanding happens response external internal cues decoding process ascribing meaning encoding consists producing new behavioral cues response human many forms human communication central distinction whether language used contrast verbal nonverbal communication distinction concerns whether one communicates others oneself contrast interpersonal intrapersonal communication forms human communication also categorized channel medium used transmit messages field studying human communication known anthroposemiotics verbal main article linguistics verbal communication exchange messages linguistic form ie means language colloquial usage verbal communication sometimes restricted oral communication may exclude writing sign language however academic discourse term usually used wider sense encompassing form linguistic communication whether speech writing gestures challenges distinguishing verbal nonverbal communication come difficulties defining exactly language means language usually understood conventional system symbols rules used communication systems based set simple units meaning combined express complex ideas rules combining units compound expressions called grammar words combined form sentences one hallmark human language contrast animal communication lies complexity expressive power human language used refer concrete objects hereandnow also spatially temporally distant objects abstract ideas humans natural tendency acquire native language childhood also able learn languages later life second languages however process less intuitive often result level linguistic competence academic discipline studying language called linguistics subfields include semantics study meaning morphology study word formation syntax study sentence structure pragmatics study language use phonetics study basic sounds central contrast among languages natural artificial constructed languages natural languages like english spanish japanese developed naturally part unplanned course history artificial languages like esperanto quenya c language firstorder logic purposefully designed ground everyday verbal communication happens using natural languages central forms verbal communication speech writing together counterparts listening reading spoken languages use sounds produce signs transmit meaning writing signs physically inscribed surface sign languages like american sign language nicaraguan sign language another form verbal communication rely visual means mostly using gestures hands arms form sentences convey meaning verbal communication serves various functions one key function exchange information ie attempt speaker make audience aware something usually external event language also used express speakers feelings attitudes closely related role establish maintain social relations people verbal communication also utilized coordinate ones behavior others influence cases language employed external purpose entertainment personal enjoyment verbal communication helps individuals conceptualize world around affects perceptions external events interpreted things categorized ideas organized related nonverbal main article nonverbal communication shaking hands one form nonverbal communication nonverbal communication exchange information nonlinguistic modes like facial expressions gestures postures however every form nonverbal behavior constitutes nonverbal communication theorists like judee burgoon hold depends existence socially shared coding system used interpret meaning nonverbal behavior nonverbal communication many functions frequently contains information emotions attitudes personality interpersonal relations private thoughts nonverbal communication often happens unintentionally unconsciously like sweating blushing also conscious intentional forms like shaking hands raising thumb often happens simultaneously verbal communication helps optimize exchange emphasis illustration adding additional information nonverbal cues clarify intent behind verbal message using multiple modalities communication way usually makes communication effective messages modality consistent however cases different modalities contain conflicting messages example person may verbally agree statement press lips together thereby indicating disagreement nonverbally many forms nonverbal communication include kinesics proxemics haptics paralanguage chronemics physical kinesics studies role bodily behavior conveying information commonly referred body language even though strictly speaking language rather nonverbal communication includes many forms like gestures postures walking styles dance facial expressions like laughing smiling frowning belong kinesics expressive flexible forms communication oculesics another subcategory kinesics regard eyes covers questions like eye contact gaze blink rate pupil dilation form part communication kinesic patterns inborn involuntary like blinking others learned voluntary like giving military salute proxemics studies personal space used communication distance speakers reflects degree familiarity intimacy well social status haptics examines information conveyed using touching behavior like handshakes holding hands kissing slapping meanings linked haptics include care concern anger violence instance handshaking often seen symbol equality fairness refusing shake hands indicate aggressiveness kissing another form often used show affection erotic closeness paralanguage also known vocalics encompasses nonverbal elements speech convey information paralanguage often used express feelings emotions speaker explicitly stated verbal part message concerned words used expressed includes elements like articulation lip control rhythm intensity pitch fluency loudness example saying something loudly high pitch conveys different meaning nonverbal level whispering words paralanguage mainly concerned spoken language also includes aspects written language like use colors fonts well spatial arrangement paragraphs tables nonlinguistic sounds may also convey information crying indicates infant distressed babbling conveys information infant health wellbeing chronemics concerns use time messages sent time versus late meeting physical communicator height weight hair skin color gender clothing tattooing piercing also carries information important factor first impressions limited mode communication since less changeable forms nonverbal communication happen using artifacts drums smoke batons traffic lights flags nonverbal communication also happen visual media like paintings drawings express person object looks like also convey ideas emotions cases type nonverbal communication used combination verbal communication example diagrams maps employ labels include additional linguistic information traditionally focused verbal communication however paradigm began shift interest nonverbal communication increased emphasized influence example many judgments nature behavior people based nonverbal cues present almost every communicative act extent certain parts universally understood considerations prompted communication theorists like ray birdwhistell claim majority ideas information conveyed way also suggested human communication core nonverbal words acquire meaning nonverbal communication earliest forms human communication crying babbling nonverbal basic forms communication happen even birth mother embryo include information nutrition emotions nonverbal communication studied various fields besides communication studies like linguistics semiotics anthropology social psychology interpersonal main article interpersonal communication kathy matayoshi mazie hirono conversing white house example interpersonal communication interpersonal communication communication distinct people typical form dyadic communication ie two people also refer communication within groups planned unplanned occurs many forms like greeting someone salary negotiations making phone call communication theorists like virginia mcdermott understand interpersonal communication fuzzy concept manifests degrees view exchange varies interpersonal based several factors depends many people present whether happens facetoface rather telephone email factor concerns relation communicators group communication mass communication less typical forms interpersonal communication theorists treat distinct types interpersonal communication synchronous asynchronous asynchronous communication parties take turns sending receiving messages occurs exchanging letters emails synchronous communication parties send messages time happens one person talking person sends nonverbal messages response signaling whether agree said communication theorists like sarah trenholm arthur jensen distinguish content messages relational messages content messages express speakers feelings toward topic discussion relational messages hand demonstrate speakers feelings toward relation participants various theories function interpersonal communication proposed focus helps people make sense world create society others hold primary purpose understand people act way adjust ones behavior accordingly closely related approach focus information see interpersonal communication attempt reduce uncertainty others external events explanations understand terms needs satisfies includes needs belonging somewhere included liked maintaining relationships influencing behavior others practical level interpersonal communication used coordinate ones actions actions others get things done interpersonal communication includes topics like people build maintain dissolve relationships communication questions people choose one message rather another effects messages communicators relation topic predict whether two people would like intrapersonal main article intrapersonal communication paul csar helleus painting rverie daydream featuring alice gurin daydreaming form intrapersonal communication intrapersonal communication communication oneself cases manifests externally engaged monologue taking notes highlighting passage writing diary shopping list many forms intrapersonal communication happen internally form inner exchange oneself thinking something daydreaming closely related intrapersonal communication communication takes place within organism personal level exchange information organs cells intrapersonal communication triggered internal external stimuli may happen form articulating phrase expressing externally forms make plans future attempt process emotions calm oneself stressful situations help regulate ones mental activity outward behavior well internalize cultural norms ways thinking external forms intrapersonal communication aid ones memory happens example making shopping list another use unravel difficult problems solving complex mathematical equation line line new knowledge also internalized way repeating new vocabulary oneself functions intrapersonal communication understood exceptionally powerful pervasive tool thinking based role selfregulation theorists suggested intrapersonal communication basic interpersonal communication young children sometimes use egocentric speech playing attempt direct behavior view interpersonal communication develops later child moves early egocentric perspective social perspective different explanation holds interpersonal communication basic since first used parents regulate child child learned apply technique get control behavior channels communication successful message travel sender receiver channel way accomplished concerned meaning message technical means meaning conveyed channels often understood terms senses used perceive message ie hearing seeing smelling touching tasting widest sense channels encompass form transmission including technological means like books cables radio waves telephones television naturally transmitted messages usually fade rapidly whereas messages using artificial channels much longer lifespan case books sculptures physical characteristics channel impact code cues used express information example typical telephone calls restricted use verbal language paralanguage exclude facial expressions often possible translate messages one code another make available different channel example writing spoken message expressing using sign language transmission information occur multiple channels example facetoface communication often combines auditory channel convey verbal information visual channel transmit nonverbal information using gestures facial expressions employing multiple channels enhance effectiveness communication helping receiver better understand subject matter choice channels often matters since receivers ability understand may vary depending chosen channel instance teacher may decide present information orally information visually depending content students preferred learning style underlines role mediaadequate approach communicative competence main article communicative competence communicative competence ability communicate effectively choose appropriate communicative behavior given situation concerns say say say includes ability receive understand messages competence often contrasted performance since competence present even exercised performance consists realization competence however theorists reject stark contrast hold performance observable part used infer competence relation future performances two central components communicative competence effectiveness appropriateness effectiveness degree speaker achieves desired outcomes degree preferred alternatives realized means whether communicative behavior effective depend actual outcome also speakers intention ie whether outcome intended achieve theorists additionally require speaker able give explanation engaged one behavior rather another effectiveness closely related efficiency difference effectiveness achieving goals efficiency using resources time effort money process appropriateness means communicative behavior meets social standards expectations communication theorist brian h spitzberg defines perceived legitimacy acceptability behavior enactments given context means speaker aware social cultural context order adapt express message way considered acceptable given situation example bid farewell teacher student may use expression goodbye sir expression got ta split man may use talking peer effective appropriate means achieve ones preferred outcomes way follows social standards expectations definitions communicative competence put main emphasis either effectiveness appropriateness others combine features many additional components communicative competence suggested empathy control flexibility sensitivity knowledge often discussed terms individual skills employed process ie specific behavioral components make communicative competence message production skills include reading writing correlated reception skills listening reading verbal nonverbal communication skills example verbal communication skills involve proper understanding language including phonology orthography syntax lexicon semantics many aspects human life depend successful communication ensuring basic necessities survival building maintaining relationships communicative competence key factor regarding whether person able reach goals social life like successful career finding suitable spouse large impact individuals wellbeing lack communicative competence cause problems individual societal level including professional academic health problems barriers effective communication distort message may result failed communication cause undesirable effects happen message poorly expressed uses terms receiver familiar relevant receivers needs contains little much information distraction selective perception lack attention feedback may also responsible noise another negative factor concerns influences interfere message way receiver distort crackling sounds telephone call one form noise ambiguous expressions also inhibit effective communication make necessary disambiguate possible interpretations discern senders intention interpretations depend also cultural background participants significant cultural differences constitute additional obstacle make likely messages misinterpreted species see also biocommunication science biosemiotics wolves communicate howling besides human communication many forms communication found animal kingdom among plants studied fields like biocommunication biosemiotics additional obstacles area judging whether communication taken place two individuals acoustic signals often easy notice analyze scientists difficult judge whether tactile chemical changes understood communicative signals rather biological processes reason reers often use slightly altered definitions communication facilitate work common assumption regard comes evolutionary biology holds communication somehow benefit communicators terms natural selection biologists rumsas blatrix veronika mayer define communication exchange information individuals wherein signaller receiver may expect benefit exchange according view sender benefits influencing receivers behavior receiver benefits responding signal benefits exist average necessarily every single case way deceptive signaling also understood form communication one problem evolutionary approach often difficult assess impact behavior natural selection another common pragmatic constraint hold necessary observe response receiver following signal judging whether communication occurred animals main article animal communication animal communication process giving taking information among animals field studying animal communication called zoosemiotics many parallels human communication one humans many animals express sympathy synchronizing movements postures nonetheless also significant differences like fact humans also engage verbal communication uses language animal communication restricted nonverbal ie nonlinguistic communication theorists tried distinguish human animal communication based claim animal communication lacks referential function thus able refer external phenomena however various observations seem contradict view warning signals response different types predators used vervet monkeys gunnisons prairie dogs red squirrels approach draw distinction based complexity human language especially almost limitless ability combine basic units meaning complex meaning structures one view states recursion sets human language apart nonhuman communicative systems another difference human communication frequently linked conscious intention send information often discernable animal communication despite differences theorists use term animal language refer certain communicative patterns animal behavior similarities human language many species fireflies lampyris noctiluca communicate light attract mates animal communication take variety forms including visual auditory tactile olfactory gustatory communication visual communication happens form movements gestures facial expressions colors examples movements seen mating rituals colors birds rhythmic light fireflies auditory communication takes place vocalizations species like birds primates dogs auditory signals frequently used alert warn lowerorder living systems often simple response patterns auditory messages reacting either approach avoidance complex response patterns observed higher animals may use different signals different types predators responses example primates use one set signals airborne predators another land predators tactile communication occurs touch vibration stroking rubbing pressure especially relevant parentyoung relations courtship social greetings defense olfactory gustatory communication happen chemically smells tastes respectively large differences species concerning functions communication plays much realized behavior used communicate common functions include fields courtship mating parentoffspring relations social relations selfdefense territoriality one part courtship mating consists identifying attracting potential mates happen various means grasshoppers crickets communicate acoustically using songs moths rely chemical means releasing pheromones fireflies send visual messages flashing light species offspring depends parent survival one central function parentoffspring communication recognize cases parents also able guide offsprings behavior social animals like chimpanzees bonobos wolves dogs engage various forms communication express feelings build relations communication aid helping animals move environment purposeful way eg locate food avoid enemies follow animals bats happens echolocation ie sending auditory signals processing information echoes bees another oftendiscussed case respect since perform type dance indicate bees flowers located regard selfdefense communication used warn others assess whether costly fight avoided another function communication mark claim territories used food mating example male birds claim hedge part meadow using songs keep males away attract females two competing theories study animal communication nature theory nurture theory conflict concerns extent animal communication programmed genes form adaptation rather learned previous experience form conditioning degree learned usually happens imprinting ie form learning occurs certain phase mostly irreversible plants fungi bacteria plant communication refers plant processes involving sending receiving information field studying plant communication called phytosemiotics field poses additional difficulties reers since plants different humans animals lack central nervous system rigid cell walls walls restrict movement usually prevent plants sending receiving signals depend rapid movement however similarities since plants face many challenges animals example need find resources avoid predators pathogens find mates ensure offspring survive many evolutionary responses challenges analogous animals implemented using different means one crucial difference chemical communication much prominent plant kingdom contrast importance visual auditory communication animals steps plant communication plants term behavior usually defined terms physical movement case animals biochemical response stimulus response short relative plants lifespan communication special form behavior involves conveying information sender receiver distinguished types behavior like defensive reactions mere sensing like field animal communication plant communication reers often require additional criteria form response receiver communicative behavior beneficial sender receiver biologist richard karban distinguishes three steps plant communication emission cue sender perception cue receiver receivers response plant communication relevant extent emission cue intentional however possible receiver ignore signal criterion used distinguish response signal defense mechanism unwanted change like intense heat plant communication happens various forms includes communication within plants ie within plant cells plant cells plants related species plants nonplant organisms especially root zone prominent form communication airborne happens volatile organic compounds vocs example maple trees release vocs attacked herbivore warn neighboring plants react accordingly adjusting defenses another form planttoplant communication happens mycorrhizal fungi fungi form underground networks colloquially referred woodwide web connect roots different plants plants use network send messages specifically warn plants pest attack help prepare defenses communication also observed fungi bacteria fungal species communicate releasing pheromones external environment instance used promote sexual interaction several aquatic fungal species one form communication bacteria called quorum sensing happens releasing hormonelike molecules bacteria detect respond process used monitor environment bacteria coordinate populationwide responses example sensing density bacteria regulating gene expression accordingly possible responses include induction bioluminescence formation biofilms interspecies main article interspecies communication communication happens members within species intraspecies communication purpose communication usually form cooperation cooperation happens mostly within species different species often conflict competing resources however also forms interspecies communication occurs especially symbiotic relations significantly less parasitic predatorprey relations honeybee cosmos bipinnatus many flowers use vivid colors signal insects offer food like nectar interspecies communication plays key role plants depend external agents reproduction example flowers need insects pollination provide resources like nectar rewards return use communication signal benefits attract visitors using distinctive colors symmetrical shapes stand surroundings form advertisement necessary since flowers compete visitors many fruitbearing plants rely planttoanimal communication disperse seeds move favorable location happens providing nutritious fruits animals seeds eaten together fruit later excreted different location communication makes animals aware fruits whether ripe many fruits happens color inconspicuous green color ripen take new color stands visual contrast environment another example interspecies communication found antplant relation concerns instance selection seeds ants ant gardens pruning exogenous vegetation well plant protection ants animal species also engage interspecies communication like apes whales dolphins elephants dogs example different species monkeys use common signals cooperate threatened common predator humans engage interspecies communication interacting pets working animals instance acoustic signals play central role communication dogs dogs learn react various commands like sit come even trained respond short syntactic combinations like bring x put x box also react pitch frequency human voice detect emotions dominance uncertainty dogs use range behavioral patterns convey emotions humans example regard aggressiveness fearfulness playfulness computer main article computer networks example computer communication modems act transmitter receiver public telephone network used transmission system computer communication concerns exchange data computers similar devices possible devices connected transmission system forms network transmitter needed send messages receiver needed receive personal computer may use modem transmitter send information server public telephone network transmission system server may use modem receiver transmit data converted electric signal communication channels used transmission either analog digital characterized features like bandwidth latency many forms computer networks commonly discussed ones lans wans lan stands local area network computer network within limited area usually distance less one kilometer case connecting two computers within home office building lans set using wired connection like ethernet wireless connection like wifi wans hand wide area networks span large geographical regions like internet networks complex may use several intermediate connection nodes transfer information endpoints types computer networks include pans personal area networks cans campus area networks mans metropolitan area networks computer communication successful involved devices follow common set conventions governing exchange conventions known communication protocol concern various aspects exchange like format messages respond transmission errors also cover two systems synchronized example receiver identifies start end signal based flow informations systems categorized simplex halfduplex fullduplex simplex systems signals flow one direction sender receiver like radio cable television screens displaying arrivals departures airports halfduplex systems allow twoway exchanges signals flow one direction time like walkietalkies police radios case fullduplex systems signals flow directions time like regular telephone internet either case often important successful communication connection secure ensure transmitted data reaches intended destination intercepted unauthorized third party achieved using cryptography changes format transmitted information make unintelligible potential interceptors humancomputer communication closely related field concerns topics like humans interact computers data form inputs outputs exchanged happens user interface includes hardware used interact computer like mouse keyboard monitor well software used process software side early user interfaces commandline interfaces user must type command interact computer modern user interfaces graphical user interfaces like microsoft windows macos usually much easier use nonexperts involve graphical elements user interact computer commonly using design concept known skeumorphism make new concept feel familiar speed understanding mimicking realworld equivalent interface object examples include typical computer folder icon recycle bin used discarding files one aim designing user interfaces simplify interaction computers helps make userfriendly accessible wider audience also increasing productivity communication studies main article communication studies communication studies also referred communication science academic discipline studying communication closely related semiotics one difference communication studies focuses technical questions messages sent received processed semiotics hand tackles abstract questions relation meaning signs acquire communication studies covers wide area overlapping many disciplines biology anthropology psychology sociology linguistics media studies journalism many contributions field communication studies focus developing models theories communication models communication aim give simplified overview main components involved communication theories communication try provide conceptual frameworks accurately present communication complexity theories focus communication practical art discourse others explore roles signs experience information processing goal building social order coordinated interaction communication studies also interested functions effects communication covers issues like communication satisfies physiological psychological needs helps build relationships assists gathering information environment individuals oneself topic concerns question communication systems change time changes correlate societal changes related topic focuses psychological principles underlying changes effects people exchange ideas communication studied early ancient greece early influential theories created plato aristotle stressed public speaking understanding rhetoric according aristotle example goal communication persuade audience field communication studies became separate discipline th century especially starting development new communication technologies telephone radio newspapers television internet big impact communication communication studies today communication studies wide discipline works try provide general characterization communication widest sense others attempt give precise analysis one specific form communication communication studies includes many subfields focus wide topics like interpersonal communication intrapersonal communication verbal communication nonverbal communication others investigate communication within specific area organizational communication concerns communication members organizations corporations nonprofits small businesses central regard coordination behavior different members well interaction customers general public closely related terms business communication corporate communication professional communication main element marketing communication advertising also encompasses communication activities aimed advancing organizations objective audiences like public relations political communication covers topics like electoral campaigns influence voters legislative communication like letters congress committee documents specific emphasis often given propaganda role mass media intercultural communication relevant organizational political communication since often involve attempts exchange messages communicators different cultural backgrounds cultural background affects messages formulated interpreted cause misunderstandings also relevant development communication use communication assisting development like aid given firstworld countries thirdworld countries health communication concerns communication field healthcare health promotion efforts one topics healthcare providers like doctors nurses communicate patients history main article history communication communication history studies communicative processes evolved interacted society culture technology human communication long history way people communicate changed considerably time many changes triggered development new communication technologies various effects people exchanged ideas new communication technologies usually require new skills people need learn use effectively academic literature history communication usually divided ages based dominant form communication age number ages precise periodization disputed usually include ages speaking writing print well electronic mass communication internet according communication theorist marshall poe dominant media age characterized relation several factors include amount information medium store long persists much time takes transmit costly use medium poe argues subsequent ages usually involve form improvement one factors according scientific estimates language developed around years ago others consider much older development human communication resembled animal communication happened combination grunts cries gestures facial expressions language helped early humans organize plan ahead efficiently early societies spoken language primary form communication knowledge passed often form stories wise sayings form produce stable knowledge since depends imperfect human memory many details differ one telling next presented differently distinct storytellers people started settle form agricultural communities societies grew increased need stable records ownership land commercial transactions triggered invention writing able solve many problems arose using exclusively oral communication much efficient preserving knowledge passing generations since depend human memory invention writing certain forms protowriting already developed protowriting encompasses longlasting visible marks used store information like decorations pottery items knots cord track goods seals mark property sales contract inscribed clay tablet using precuneiform script early written communication happened pictograms pictograms graphical symbols convey meaning visually resembling realworld objects use basic pictographic symbols represent things like farming produce common ancient cultures began around bce first complex writing system including pictograms developed around bce sumerians called cuneiform pictograms still use today like nosmoking signs symbols male female figures bathroom doors significant disadvantage pictographic writing systems need large amount symbols refer objects one wants talk problem solved development writing systems example symbols alphabetic writing systems stand regular objects instead relate sounds used spoken language types early writing systems include logographic ideographic writing systems drawback many early forms writing like clay tablets used cuneiform portable made difficult transport texts one location another share information changed invention papyrus egyptians around bce improved later development parchment paper almost written communication handwritten limited spread written media within society since copying texts hand costly introduction popularization mass printing middle th century johann gutenberg resulted rapid changes mass printing quickly increased circulation written media also led dissemination new forms written documents like newspapers pamphlets one side effect augmented availability written documents significantly improved general literacy population development served foundation revolutions various fields including science politics religion scientific discoveries th th centuries caused many developments history communication include invention telegraphs telephones made even easier faster transmit information one location another without need transport written documents communication forms initially limited cable connections established first later developments found ways wireless transmission using radio signals made possible reach wide audiences radio soon became one central forms mass communication various innovations field photography enabled recording images film led development cinema television reach wireless communication enhanced development satellites made possible broadcast radio television signals stations world way information could shared almost
