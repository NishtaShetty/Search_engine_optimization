usability user experience computer software design user interface ui design primarily focuses information architecture process building interfaces clearly communicate user whats important ui design refers graphical user interfaces forms interface design goal user interface design make users interaction simple efficient possible terms accomplishing user goals usercentered design usercentered design typically accomplished execution modern design thinking involves empathizing target audience defining problem statement ideating potential solutions prototyping wireframes testing prototypes order refine final interface mockups user interfaces points interaction users designs three types user interfaces graphical user interfaces guis users interact visual representations computers screen desktop example gui interfaces controlled voice users interact voices smart assistants siri smartphones alexa amazon devices use voice control interactive interfaces utilizing gestures users interact design environments bodies eg virtual reality vr games interface design involved wide range projects computer systems cars commercial planes projects involve much basic human interactions yet also require unique skills knowledge result designers tend specialize certain types projects skills centered expertise whether software design user web design industrial design good user interface design facilitates finishing task hand without drawing unnecessary attention graphic design typography utilized support usability influencing user performs certain interactions improving aesthetic appeal design design aesthetics may enhance detract ability users use functions interface design process must balance technical functionality visual elements eg mental model create system operational also usable adaptable changing user needs ui design vs ux design compared ux design ui design surface overall look design user interface design craft designers perform important function creating user experience ui design keep users informed happening giving appropriate feedback timely manner visual look feel ui design sets tone user experience hand term ux design refers entire process creating user experience norman jakob nielsen said important distinguish total user experience user interface ui even though ui obviously extremely important part design example consider website movie reviews even ui finding film perfect ux poor user wants information small independent release underlying database contains movies major studios design thinking printable template mobile desktop app design pdf user interface design requires good understanding user needs mainly focuses needs platform user expectations several phases processes user interface design demanded upon others depending project modern design thinking framework created david kelley founder stanfords dschool formally known hasso plattner institute design edipt common acronym used describe kelleys design thinking frameworkit stands empathize define ideate prototype test notably edipt framework nonlinear therefore ui designer may jump one stage another developing usercentric solution iteration common practice design thinking process successful solutions often require testing tweaking ensure product fulfills user needs edipt empathize conducting user better understand needs pain points target audience ui designers avoid developing solutions based personal beliefs instead seek understand unique perspectives various users qualitative data often gathered form semistructured interviews common areas interest include would user want system would system fit users normal workflow daily activities technically savvy user similar systems user already use interface aesthetics functionalities styles appeal user define solidifying problem statement focuses user needs desires effective problem statements typically one sentence long include user specific need desired outcome goal ideate brainstorming potential solutions address refined problem statement proposed solutions ideally align stakeholders feasibility viability criteria maintaining user desirability standards prototype designing potential solutions varying fidelity low mid high applying user experience principles methodologies prototyping iterative process ui designers explore multiple design solutions rather settling initial concept test presenting prototypes target audience gather feedback gain insights improvement based results ui designers may need revisit earlier stages design process enhance prototype user experience usability testing nielsen norman group cofounded jakob nielsen norman promotes user experience interface design education jakob nielsen pioneered interface usability movement created usability heuristics user interface design usability aimed defining interfaces quality considering ease use interface low usability burden user hinder achieving goals resulting dismissal interface enhance usability user experience reers may conduct usability testinga process evaluates users interact interface usability testing provide insight user pain points illustrating efficiently user complete task without error highlighting areas design improvement usability inspection letting evaluator inspect user interface generally considered cheaper implement usability testing see step used early development process since used evaluate prototypes specifications system usually tested users common usability inspection methods include cognitive walkthrough focuses simplicity accomplish tasks system new users heuristic evaluation set heuristics used identify usability problems ui design pluralistic walkthrough selected group people step task scenario discuss usability issues usability testing testing prototypes actual useroften using technique called think aloud protocol user asked talk thoughts experience user interface design testing allows designer understand reception design viewers standpoint
