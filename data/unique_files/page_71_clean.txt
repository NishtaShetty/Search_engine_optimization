particularly wake lucas critique much modern macroeconomic theories built upon microfoundationsie based upon basic assumptions microlevel behavior assumptions definitions microeconomic study historically performed according general equilibrium theory developed lon walras elements pure economics partial equilibrium theory introduced alfred marshall principles economics microeconomic theory typically begins study single rational utility maximizing individual economists rationality means individual possesses stable preferences complete transitive technical assumption preference relations continuous needed ensure existence utility function although microeconomic theory continue without assumption would make comparative statics impossible since guarantee resulting utility function would differentiable microeconomic theory progresses defining competitive budget set subset consumption set point economists make technical assumption preferences locally nonsatiated without assumption lns local nonsatiation guarantee would rational rise individual utility necessary assumptions place utility maximization problem ump developed utility maximization problem heart consumer theory utility maximization problem attempts explain action axiom imposing rationality axioms consumer preferences mathematically modeling analyzing consequences utility maximization problem serves mathematical foundation consumer theory metaphysical explanation well utility maximization problem used economists explain individuals make choices individuals make choices well utility maximization problem constrained optimization problem individual seeks maximize utility subject budget constraint economists use extreme value theorem guarantee solution utility maximization problem exists since budget constraint bounded closed solution utility maximization problem exists economists call solution utility maximization problem walrasian demand function correspondence utility maximization problem far developed taking consumer tastes ie consumer utility primitive however alternative way develop microeconomic theory taking consumer choice primitive model microeconomic theory referred revealed preference theory supply demand model describes prices vary result balance product availability price supply desires purchasing power price demand graph depicts rightshift demand along consequent increase price quantity required reach new marketclearing equilibrium point supply curve theory supply demand usually assumes markets perfectly competitive implies many buyers sellers market none capacity significantly influence prices goods services many reallife transactions assumption fails individual buyers sellers ability influence prices quite often sophisticated analysis required understand demandsupply equation good model however theory works well situations meeting assumptions mainstream economics assume priori markets preferable forms social organization fact much analysis devoted cases market failures lead resource allocation suboptimal creates deadweight loss classic example suboptimal resource allocation public good cases economists may attempt find policies avoid waste either directly government control indirectly regulation induces market participants act manner consistent optimal welfare creating missing markets enable efficient trading none previously existed studied field collective action public choice theory optimal welfare usually takes paretian norm mathematical application kaldorhicks method diverge utilitarian goal maximizing utility consider distribution goods people market failure positive economics microeconomics limited implications without mixing belief economist theory demand various commodities individuals generally thought outcome utilitymaximizing process individual trying maximize utility budget constraint given consumption set allocation scarce resources individuals firms need allocate limited resources ensure agents economy well firms decide goods services produce considering low costs involving labour materials capital well potential profit margins consumers choose good services want maximize happiness taking account limited wealth government make allocation decisions independently made consumers firms example former soviet union government played part informing car manufacturers cars produce consumers gain access car history main article history microeconomics economists commonly consider microeconomists macroeconomists difference microeconomics macroeconomics likely introduced norwegian economist ragnar frisch corecipient first nobel memorial prize economic sciences however frisch actually use word microeconomics instead drawing distinctions microdynamic macrodynamic analysis way similar words microeconomics macroeconomics used today first known use term microeconomics published article pieter de wolff broadened term microdynamics microeconomics microeconomic theory consumer demand theory main article consumer choice consumer demand theory relates preferences consumption goods services consumption expenditures ultimately relationship preferences consumption expenditures used relate preferences consumer demand curves link personal preferences consumption demand curve one closely studied relations economics way analyzing consumers may achieve equilibrium preferences expenditures maximizing utility subject consumer budget constraints production theory main article production theory production theory study production economic process converting inputs outputs production uses resources create good service suitable use giftgiving gift economy exchange market economy include manufacturing storing shipping packaging economists define production broadly economic activity consumption see every commercial activity final purchase form production costofproduction theory value main article costofproduction theory value costofproduction theory value states price object condition determined sum cost resources went making cost comprise factors production including labor capital land taxation technology viewed either form fixed capital eg industrial plant circulating capital eg intermediate goods mathematical model cost production shortrun total cost equal fixed cost plus total variable cost fixed cost refers cost incurred regardless much firm produces variable cost function quantity object produced cost function used characterize production duality theory economics developed mainly ronald shephard scholars sickles zelenyuk ch fixed variable costs fixed cost fc cost change output includes business expenses rent salaries utility bills variable cost vc cost changes output changes includes raw materials delivery costs production supplies short time period months costs fixed costs firm pay salaries contracted shipment materials used produce various goods longer time period years costs become variable firms decide reduce output purchase fewer materials even sell machinery years costs become variable workers laid new machinery bought replace old machinery sunk costs fixed cost already incurred recovered example rd development like pharmaceutical industry hundreds millions dollars spent achieve new drug breakthroughs challenging increasingly harder find new breakthroughs meet tighter regulation standards thus many projects written leading losses millions dollars opportunity cost main article opportunity cost opportunity cost closely related idea time constraints one one thing time means inevitably one always giving things opportunity cost activity value nextbest alternative thing one may done instead opportunity cost depends value nextbest alternative matter whether one five alternatives opportunity costs tell something well something example one may like waffles like chocolate even someone offers waffles one would take offered waffles chocolate one would take chocolate opportunity cost eating waffles sacrificing chance eat chocolate cost eating chocolate higher benefits eating waffles makes sense choose waffles course one chooses chocolate still faced opportunity cost giving waffles one willing waffles opportunity cost lower benefits chocolate opportunity costs unavoidable constraints behavior one decide whats best give nextbest alternative price theory microeconomics also known price theory highlight significance prices relation buyer sellers agents determine prices due individual actions price theory field economics uses supply demand framework explain predict human behavior associated chicago school economics price theory studies competitive equilibrium markets yield testable hypotheses rejected price theory microeconomics strategic behavior interactions among sellers market significant part microeconomics emphasized price theory price theorists focus competition believing reasonable description markets leaves room study additional aspects tastes technology result price theory tends use less game theory microeconomics price theory focuses agents respond prices framework applied wide variety socioeconomic issues might seem involve prices first glance price theorists influenced several fields including developing public choice theory law economics price theory applied issues previously thought outside purview economics criminal justice marriage addiction microeconomic models supply demand main article supply demand supply demand economic model price determination perfectly competitive market concludes perfectly competitive market externalities per unit taxes price controls unit price particular good price quantity demanded consumers equals quantity supplied producers price results stable economic equilibrium supply demand model describes prices vary result balance product availability demand graph depicts increase rightshift demand along consequent increase price quantity required reach new equilibrium point supply curve prices quantities described directly observable attributes goods produced exchanged market economy theory supply demand organizing principle explaining prices coordinate amounts produced consumed microeconomics applies price output determination market perfect competition includes condition buyers sellers large enough pricesetting power given market commodity demand relation quantity buyers would prepared purchase unit price good demand often represented table graph showing price quantity demanded figure demand theory describes individual consumers rationally choosing preferred quantity good given income prices tastes etc term constrained utility maximization income wealth constraints demand utility refers hypothesized relation individual consumer ranking different commodity bundles less preferred law demand states general price quantity demanded given market inversely related higher price product less people would prepared buy things unchanged price commodity falls consumers move toward relatively expensive goods substitution effect addition purchasing power price decline increases ability buy income effect factors change demand example increase income shift demand curve normal good outward relative origin figure determinants predominantly taken constant factors demand supply supply relation price good quantity available sale price may represented table graph relating price quantity supplied producers example business firms hypothesized profit maximizers meaning attempt produce supply amount goods bring highest profit supply typically represented function relating price quantity factors unchanged higher price good sold producers supply figure higher price makes profitable increase production demand side position supply shift say change price productive input technical improvement law supply states general rise price leads expansion supply fall price leads contraction supply well determinants supply price substitutes cost production technology applied various factors inputs production taken constant specific time period evaluation supply market equilibrium occurs quantity supplied equals quantity demanded intersection supply demand curves figure price equilibrium shortage quantity supplied compared quantity demanded posited bid price price equilibrium surplus quantity supplied compared quantity demanded pushes price model supply demand predicts given supply demand curves price quantity stabilize price makes quantity supplied equal quantity demanded similarly demandandsupply theory predicts new pricequantity combination shift demand figure supply given quantity consumer good point demand curve indicates value marginal utility consumers unit measures consumer would prepared pay unit corresponding point supply curve measures marginal cost increase total cost supplier corresponding unit good price equilibrium determined supply demand perfectly competitive market supply demand equate marginal cost marginal utility equilibrium supply side

analogously producer compares marginal revenue identical price perfect competitor marginal cost good marginal profit difference point marginal profit reaches zero increases production good stop movement market equilibrium changes equilibrium price quantity also change margin moreorless something rather necessarily allornothing applications demand supply include distribution income among factors production including labor capital factor markets competitive labor market example quantity labor employed price labor wage rate depends demand labor employers production supply labor

economic theory may also specify conditions supply demand market efficient mechanism allocating resources market structure main article market structuremarket structure refers features market including number firms market distribution market shares product uniformity across firms easy firms enter exit market forms competition market market structure several types interacting market systems different forms markets feature capitalism market socialism advocates state socialism often criticizing markets aiming substitute replace markets varying degrees governmentdirected economic planning competition acts regulatory mechanism market systems government providing regulations market expected regulate regulations help mitigate negative externalities goods services private equilibrium market match social equilibrium one example regards building codes absent purely competition regulated market system might result several horrific injuries deaths required companies would begin improving structural safety consumers may first concerned aware safety issues begin putting pressure companies provide companies would motivated provide proper safety features due would cut profits concept market type different concept market structure nevertheless variety types markets different market structures produce cost curves based type structure present different curves developed based costs production specifically graph contains marginal cost average total cost average variable cost average fixed cost marginal revenue sometimes equal demand average revenue price pricetaking firm perfect competition main article perfect competition perfect competition situation numerous small firms producing identical products compete given industry perfect competition leads firms producing socially optimal output level minimum possible cost per unit firms perfect competition price takers enough market power profitably increase price goods services good example would digital marketplaces ebay many different sellers sell similar products many different buyers consumers perfect competitive market perfect knowledge products sold market imperfect competition main article imperfect competition imperfect competition type market structure showing features competitive markets perfect competition market power achievable due high level producers causing high levels competition therefore prices brought marginal cost level monopoly market power achieved one firm leading prices higher marginal cost level two types markets firms neither perfectly competitive monopolistic firms pepsi coke sony nintendo microsoft dominate cola video game industry respectively firms imperfect competition monopolistic competition main article monopolistic competition monopolistic competition situation many firms slightly different products compete production costs may achieved perfectly competitive firms society benefits product differentiation examples industries market structures similar monopolistic competition include restaurants cereal clothing shoes service industries large cities monopoly main article monopoly monopoly market structure market industry dominated single
