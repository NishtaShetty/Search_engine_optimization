field called data analysis resembles modern data science lecture given chinese academy sciences beijing c f jeff wu used term data science first time alternative name statistics later attendees statistics symposium university montpellier ii acknowledged emergence new discipline focused data various origins forms combining established concepts principles statistics data analysis computing term data science traced back peter naur proposed alternative name computer science international federation classification societies became first conference specifically feature data science topic however definition still flux lecture chinese academy sciences beijing c f jeff wu suggested statistics renamed data science reasoned new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes
